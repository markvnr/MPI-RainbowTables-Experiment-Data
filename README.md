# MPI-RainbowTables-Experiment-Data
This repo contains the data for the experiments of parallel rainbow tables generation using Message Passing Interface (MPI)

first_experiment_case1_10000x20000.csv contains the data of the case 1 of the first experiment which evaluates the effect of the number of nodes on execution time, speedup, and efficiency for a table of size 10000x20000.  
first_experiment_case1_50000x40000.csv contains the data of the case 2 of the first experiment which evaluates the effect of the number of nodes on execution time, speedup, and efficiency for a table of size 50000x40000.
second_experiment.csv contains the data of the second experiment which examines the impact of the number of chains on execution time.  
third_experiment.csv contains the data of the third experiment which analyzes how chain length affects execution time.
