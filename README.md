# MPI-RainbowTables-Experiment-Data
This repo contains the data for the experiments of parallel rainbow tables generation using Message Passing Interface (MPI)

first_experiment.csv contains the data of the first experiment which evaluates the effect of the number of nodes on execution time, speedup, and efficiency.  
second_experiment.csv contains the data of the second experiment which examines the impact of the number of chains on execution time.  
third_experiment.csv contains the data of the third experiment which analyzes how chain length affects execution time.
